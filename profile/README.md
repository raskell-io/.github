# raskell.io

A small independent org for building things that should keep working when reality shows up.

This is where I keep projects around:
- passion projects
- pragmatic security
- sustainable tech

## Projects

- **Sentinel**  
  A security-first reverse proxy built on Pingora. Sleepable ops at the edge.  
  Repo: [raskell-io/sentinel](https://github.com/raskell-io/sentinel)

## What you can expect here

- Simple defaults
- Practical docs
- Opinions, but with tradeoffs
- No hype
