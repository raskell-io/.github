## How we build

raskell-io is about **tech that serves humans**.

The best tools are the ones that **disappear into the background**:
- work out of the box
- feel intuitive
- have sane defaults
- stay boring where boring is good (because boring is reliable)

We don’t build complexity for its own sake. We build the **right amount of complexity**:
- simple when the problem is simple
- precise (and yes, sometimes complex) when the problem demands it

We’re **stack-agnostic on purpose**. Languages and frameworks are instruments, not identities.
We’ll use Haskell, Rust, Elixir, Go, Python — whatever fits — and treat AI/LLMs the same way:
powerful tools, not a religion.

The goal is always the same: **make good ideas real**, without making humans pay a complexity tax.


## What this org is about

- **Pragmatic security** (not performative)
- **Sustainable tech** (operable, debuggable, boring in the right ways)
- **Tasteful opinions** (defaults + tradeoffs, documented)
- **No hype** (just systems that behave)


## Flagship and serious builds

### [Sentinel](https://github.com/raskell-io/sentinel)
A security-first reverse proxy built to guard the free web based on Cloudflare's Pingora framework.

### [hx](https://github.com/raskell-io/hx)
Extremely fast Haskell package + project manager built in Rust.  

### [bhc](https://github.com/raskell-io/bhc)
The Basel Haskell Compiler. Next-gen compiler + runtime: predictable performance, structured concurrency, tensor-native numeric pipeline.  

### [Shiioo (CO)](https://github.com/raskell-io/shiioo)
The Virtual Company OS. Agentic enterprise orchestrator: DAG workflows, event sourcing, MCP tools.  

## Labs / passion projects

These are exploratory. Some will become serious. Some will stay fun.

### [terrarium](https://github.com/raskell-io/terrarium)
A societal simulation engine where LLM-powered agents form emergent civilizations 

### [robogym](https://github.com/raskell-io/robogym)
Rust/Bevy PWA for training robotic agents (very early) 

### [Paw & Claw: Woodland Wars](https://github.com/raskell-io/paw-and-claw)
HD-2D-stylized turn-based tactics game (spiritual successor Nintendo's game Advance Wars) built with Rust/Bevy.
